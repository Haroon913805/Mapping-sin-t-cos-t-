# Mapping-sin-t-cos-t-
This project demonstrates how to use a machine learning model, specifically a feedforward neural network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras, to learn the mathematical transformation from the sine function to the cosine function. The goal is to train the model to approximate the mapping  sin ⁡ ( t ) → cos ⁡ ( t ) sin(t)→cos(t).
